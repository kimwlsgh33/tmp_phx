# Refactoring Recommendations for the MyApp Project

Based on my analysis of your codebase, here are several refactoring opportunities that would improve the architecture, maintainability, and functionality:

## 1. Improve Token Management System - Completed

## 2. Complete TikTok Implementation

The TikTok module is mostly placeholder stubs returning error messages. You should:

- Implement all the required behavior callbacks
- Add proper TikTok API integration
- Ensure proper OAuth flow for TikTok
- Handle TikTok-specific media requirements

## 3. Standardize Error Handling

I noticed inconsistent error handling across implementations:

- Create a standardized error format across all social media modules
- Add proper error types and consistent error structures
- Implement better error mapping from API-specific errors to application errors

## 4. Add Test Coverage

Add comprehensive tests for:
- Each social media platform implementation
- Token management
- Error handling scenarios
- Mock external API responses

## 5. Refactor YouTube Module

There appears to be a `youtube.ex` and `youtube.ex.bak` file, suggesting recent changes:

- Review and finalize YouTube implementation
- Remove backup files
- Ensure the implementation follows the same patterns as Twitter implementation

## 6. Extract Common Functionality

There's duplicate code across platform implementations:

- Create helper modules for common tasks
- Extract shared functionality into smaller, reusable functions
- Consider using macros for repeated behavioral patterns

## 7. Improve Documentation

While basic documentation exists, you should:

- Add more detailed examples
- Document expected error cases
- Add typespecs consistently across all modules
- Document security considerations

## 8. Implement Configuration System

The presence of `social_media_config.ex` and `social_media_config_sample.ex` suggests:

- You need a proper configuration system
- Create environment-specific configurations
- Use runtime configuration for sensitive values

## Priority Order

1. Complete the TikTok implementation (highest priority, since it's currently non-functional)
2. Improve token management (critical for authentication)
3. Standardize error handling (important for consistent user experience)
4. Extract common functionality (reduces duplication)
5. Refactor YouTube module (clean up any outstanding work)
6. Improve documentation
7. Implement configuration system
8. Add test coverage
