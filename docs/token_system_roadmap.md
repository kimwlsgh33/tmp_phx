# Token Management System Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements for the token management system in our application.

## Current Status

We have completed the following improvements:

1. ✅ **Consolidated Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation to all token-related modules
2. ✅ **Code Duplication Analysis**: Identified overlap between PlatformToken and SocialMediaToken
3. ✅ **Storage Assessment**: Evaluated tradeoffs between ETS and database storage
4. ✅ **Standardized Token Operations**: Created a Common module with shared functionality
5. ✅ **Test Coverage**: Added thorough tests for the Common module

## Short-Term Improvements (1-2 Months)

### 1. Create a Unified Token Interface

**Description**: Implement a high-level Token Management API that provides a consistent interface for all token operations.

**Tasks**:
- Create a `Myapp.Tokens` module that serves as the primary entry point for all token operations
- Implement functions for all common token operations (get, store, revoke, etc.)
- Add transparent caching for frequently accessed tokens
- Ensure all operations are properly logged and traceable

**Example API**:
```elixir
# Get a token (with transparent caching)
{:ok, token} = Myapp.Tokens.get_social_token(user_id, :twitter)

# Store a new token (with proper encryption)
{:ok, token} = Myapp.Tokens.store_social_token(user_id, :twitter, token_data)

# Revoke a token (with proper cleanup)
:ok = Myapp.Tokens.revoke_social_token(user_id, :twitter)
```

### 2. Implement PlatformToken to SocialMediaToken Migration

**Description**: Create a migration path from PlatformToken to SocialMediaToken to consolidate to a single implementation.

**Tasks**:
- Create a migration script to convert existing PlatformToken records to SocialMediaToken
- Add deprecation warnings to PlatformToken functions
- Update all code using PlatformToken to use the new unified interface
- Add thorough testing for the migration process

### 3. Enhance Security with Audit Logging

**Description**: Add comprehensive audit logging for all token operations to improve security and traceability.

**Tasks**:
- Implement a TokenAudit module to track token lifecycle events
- Log all token creation, usage, refresh, and revocation events
- Include contextual information (IP address, user agent, etc.) in logs
- Ensure logs are appropriately sanitized to avoid sensitive data exposure

## Medium-Term Improvements (3-6 Months)

### 4. Consolidated Token Management Dashboard

**Description**: Build an admin interface for monitoring and managing all tokens in the system.

**Tasks**:
- Create a token management LiveView dashboard
- Add ability to view, search, and filter tokens by various criteria
- Implement manual token revocation functionality
- Add visualization of token usage patterns and potential security issues

### 5. Implement Token Rotation Policies

**Description**: Enhance security by implementing automatic token rotation based on usage patterns.

**Tasks**:
- Define token rotation policies based on age, usage frequency, and security risk
- Implement background jobs to refresh tokens before expiration
- Add mechanisms to handle failed refreshes gracefully
- Ensure application clients can handle token rotation transparently

### 6. Third-Party Token Management Interface

**Description**: Create a standardized interface for third-party applications to manage their tokens.

**Tasks**:
- Design a secure API for third-party token management
- Implement token scoping and permission controls
- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Create documentation and example clients for integration

## Long-Term Improvements (6+ Months)

### 7. Centralized Claims-Based Authorization

**Description**: Evolve the token system into a full claims-based authorization system.

**Tasks**:
- Expand token payloads to include standardized claims
- Implement validation and verification of claims
- Create authorization policies based on token claims
- Integrate with existing permission systems

### 8. Cross-Instance Token Federation

**Description**: Enable secure token usage across multiple application instances.

**Tasks**:
- Design a federation protocol for sharing token validity
- Implement secure communication channels between instances
- Create fallback mechanisms for network partitions
- Ensure consistent token state across the federation

### 9. Remove Deprecated Token Systems

**Description**: Once migration is complete, remove legacy token systems to simplify the codebase.

**Tasks**:
- Confirm all clients have migrated to the new token system
- Create migration scripts for any remaining legacy tokens
- Remove PlatformToken and other deprecated modules
- Update documentation to reference only the current system

## Success Metrics

We will measure the success of these improvements by:

1. **Reduced complexity**: Fewer lines of code, clearer interfaces
2. **Improved security**: No plaintext tokens, proper encryption, audit logging
3. **Better performance**: Reduced response times for token operations
4. **Enhanced reliability**: Fewer token-related errors and issues
5. **Easier maintenance**: More consistent patterns, better documentation

## Implementation Priority

The improvements should be implemented in the following order:

1. Unified Token Interface
2. PlatformToken Migration
3. Audit Logging
4. Token Rotation Policies
5. Token Management Dashboard
6. Third-Party Interface
7. Claims-Based Authorization
8. Federation Support
9. Removal of Deprecated Systems

This order minimizes disruption while progressively improving the system.
