### Key Points
- TikTok API allows embedding videos on websites and advanced integrations like posting content or accessing user data.
- The most common use is embedding videos using the oEmbed API, which is simple and accessible.
- Advanced features require developer registration and application approval, which can be complex.

### Embedding Videos
The TikTok API's most straightforward use is embedding videos on websites. You can do this using the oEmbed API, which lets you fetch an embed code for any public TikTok video. Here's how:

- Find the video URL, like `https://www.tiktok.com/@user123/video/1234567890`.
- Make a GET request to `https://www.tiktok.com/oembed?url=` followed by your video URL.
- The response will be a JSON object with HTML code to embed the video on your site.

For example, if you request `https://www.tiktok.com/oembed?url=https://www.tiktok.com/@user123/video/1234567890`, you'll get the embed code to paste into your website's HTML. This is great for blogs or social media aggregators.

### Advanced Integrations
For more than just embedding, like posting content or accessing user data, you need to:
- Register on the TikTok developer portal.
- Create and submit an application for review.
- Get an access token upon approval to use other API endpoints.

This process can be time-consuming and may not be approved for all uses, so it's more suited for businesses or researchers.

### Surprising Detail: Limited Public Access
It's surprising that while embedding videos is easy, other features like posting content aren't publicly accessible without a formal review, making the API more restrictive than some might expect.

### Comprehensive Usage Survey of TikTok API

This survey note provides a detailed exploration of the TikTok API, focusing on its primary usage for embedding videos and the process for accessing advanced features. It aims to offer a thorough understanding for developers and researchers, building on the direct answer provided above.

#### Introduction to TikTok API
The TikTok API is a set of tools and protocols that enable developers to integrate TikTok's features into their applications or websites. It supports various functionalities, with the most accessible being video embedding through the oEmbed API. Other uses, such as posting content or accessing user data, require additional steps and approvals, reflecting TikTok's controlled approach to API access.

#### Embedding Videos: The oEmbed API
The oEmbed API is the most user-friendly aspect of the TikTok API, allowing developers to embed TikTok videos on external websites. This is particularly useful for content creators, social media aggregators, and websites looking to enhance engagement with dynamic video content.

##### Steps for Using the oEmbed API
To embed a TikTok video, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Video URL**: Locate the URL of the TikTok video you wish to embed, such as `https://www.tiktok.com/@user123/video/1234567890`.
2. **Fetch the Embed Code**: Use the oEmbed API by making a GET request to `https://www.tiktok.com/oembed?url=` followed by the video URL. For instance, `https://www.tiktok.com/oembed?url=https://www.tiktok.com/@user123/video/1234567890`.
3. **Parse the Response**: The API returns a JSON object containing the HTML embed code. An example response might include:
   - `html`: The HTML code to embed the video, typically including a `<blockquote>` element and a script tag for `https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js`.
   - Other metadata like video title, author, and dimensions.
4. **Insert into Website**: Copy the HTML code and paste it into your website's HTML where you want the video to appear. Ensure your site can load external scripts from TikTok for the video to play.

##### Considerations and Limitations
- **Styling and Size**: The embedded video comes with default styling. Developers may need to adjust CSS to fit their website's design, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- **Video Availability**: If the original video is removed from TikTok, the embed will no longer function, displaying an error or placeholder.
- **Dependencies**: The embed relies on scripts from `tiktok.com`, so firewall restrictions or ad blockers might prevent video playback.
- **Example Use Case**: Websites like blogs or social media aggregators can use this to display TikTok videos, enhancing user engagement with dynamic content.

#### Advanced Integrations: Beyond Embedding
For developers seeking to interact with TikTok beyond embedding, such as posting content, accessing user data, or managing ads, the process is more involved. TikTok restricts these features to ensure platform security and compliance, requiring formal registration and application.

##### Registration and Application Process
To access advanced API features:

1. **Register as a Developer**: Visit the TikTok developer portal, likely accessible through `tiktok.com/developers` or related pages, and create an account. This involves verifying your email and accepting terms and conditions.
2. **Create and Submit an Application**: Develop a prototype of your application and submit it for review. This includes detailing how you intend to use the API, such as for posting content or analyzing user data.
3. **Obtain Access Token**: Upon approval, TikTok provides an access token, which is used to authenticate API requests. This token is essential for making calls to endpoints beyond embedding.

##### Types of Advanced APIs
- **Business API**: Focused on advertising and commerce, as seen in the GitHub repository for the TikTok Business API SDK ([TikTok Business API SDK](https://github.com/tiktok/tiktok-business-api-sdk)). This is used for managing ads, campaigns, and audience data, primarily for e-commerce integrations.
- **Research API**: Mentioned in a tutorial from Methods Lab ([Tutorial: When and how to use the official TikTok API](https://methodslab.weizenbaum-institut.de/2024/11/12/tutorial-when-and-how-to-use-the-official-tiktok-api/)), this is for academic research, requiring a developer account and bearer token for data scraping.
- **Content Posting and User Data**: These features are less publicly documented and require specific permissions. Developers may need to justify their use case, such as building influencer marketing tools, and wait 5-7 days for review feedback.

##### Challenges and Restrictions
- **Approval Process**: The review process can be lengthy, with potential feedback loops requiring revisions before approval. This is noted in guides like the Phyllo post ([How to Use the TikTok API - The Complete Guide for Developers](https://www.getphyllo.com/post/introduction-to-tiktok-api)).
- **Limited Access**: Not all applications are approved, especially for general public use, making these APIs more suitable for businesses, researchers, or specific use cases like social media management platforms (e.g., Hootsuite, Buffer).
- **Deprecation Risks**: As mentioned in the Phyllo guide, TikTok may deprecate or update APIs, requiring developers to migrate to new endpoints, which can impact functionality.
