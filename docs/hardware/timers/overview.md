# Timer System Overview

## Introduction
The timer system is a critical component of the AVR-based recycling control system, providing timing services for various operations including state machine control, polling intervals, motion control, communication timing, and sensor sampling.

## Key Features
- Hardware-based timing using Timer1 on AVR microcontroller
- 1ms base interval (1000 ticks per second)
- Support for up to 16 system timers
- Interrupt-driven operation
- Configurable intervals for different components

## System Components
- Main System Timers (Operation and State)
- Recycler Control Timers
- Monitor Actuator Timers
- Garbage Door Timers
- Sensor Polling Timers
