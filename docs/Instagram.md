### Key Points
- It seems likely that using the Instagram API involves setting up a Business or Creator account and linking it to a Facebook page.
- Research suggests you’ll need a Facebook Developer account to create an app and obtain an access token for API calls.
- The evidence leans toward the Instagram Basic Display API being deprecated, so focus on the Instagram Graph API for new projects.

### Overview
Using the Instagram API allows developers to interact with Instagram for tasks like managing content, analyzing insights, and integrating features into apps. The process can be complex, especially with recent changes, so here’s a simplified guide to get started.

### Steps to Use the Instagram API
1. **Account Setup:**
   - Convert your Instagram account to a Business or Creator account via account settings. This is essential as the API is only for professional accounts.
   - Create a Facebook page if you don’t have one, then link your Instagram Business account to it through the Facebook page’s settings under “Professional dashboard” and “Linked Accounts.”

2. **Developer Setup:**
   - Sign up for a Facebook Developer account at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/).
   - Create a new app in the developer portal, selecting “Business” as the category and choosing your platform (e.g., Web, Mobile).
   - Add the Instagram API product to your app by going to “Products” and selecting “Facebook Login” and “Instagram API,” then configure the settings.

3. **Authentication and Access:**
   - Set up Facebook Login for your app to authenticate users and request permissions like `pages_show_list` and `instagram_basic`.
   - Use the login flow to get an access token, which you’ll need to make API calls.

4. **Making API Calls:**
   - With the access token, you can interact with the Instagram Graph API. Check the official documentation for specific endpoints and parameters at [Instagram Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram).

### Unexpected Detail
An unexpected aspect is that your app might need to go through a review process for approval, especially for certain permissions, which can add time and complexity to the setup.

### Survey Note: Detailed Guide on Using the Instagram API

This comprehensive guide expands on the steps and considerations for using the Instagram API, drawing from recent insights and official resources. Given the platform’s evolution, particularly with the deprecation of the Instagram Basic Display API, this note aims to provide a thorough understanding for developers and businesses looking to integrate Instagram functionalities.

#### Background and Context
Instagram, owned by Meta, offers APIs to enable developers to build applications that interact with the platform, such as managing media, analyzing insights, and handling customer messages. The API landscape has shifted significantly, especially after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, leading to the replacement of the original Instagram API with the more restricted Instagram Graph API. This change, effective by 2020, reflects a focus on privacy and limits access to professional accounts only.

The Instagram Basic Display API, previously used for read-only access to user data, is being deprecated as of September 4, 2024, with all requests returning errors starting December 4, 2024. This necessitates a migration to the Instagram Graph API for new projects, which is designed for Instagram Business and Creator accounts linked to Facebook pages.

#### Step-by-Step Process for Using the Instagram API
To use the Instagram API effectively, follow these detailed steps, which align with current practices as of February 26, 2025:

1. **Convert Your Instagram Account to a Professional Account:**
   - Access your Instagram account settings and select “Switch to professional account.”
   - Choose between Business (for companies) or Creator (for individuals like influencers). This step is crucial as the API is restricted to these account types.
   - Select a category for your account and skip adding contact information if not required. This process is free and can be done via the Instagram web interface.

2. **Link Your Instagram Account to a Facebook Page:**
   - If you lack a Facebook page, create one through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/).
   - Navigate to your Facebook page’s settings, go to “Professional dashboard,” then “Linked Accounts,” and connect your Instagram Business account. This linkage is necessary for API access, as outlined in guides like [Superface.ai: Get started with Instagram API: The Setup](https://superface.ai/blog/instagram-setup).

3. **Set Up a Facebook Developer Account:**
   - Register or log in at the [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) portal. This account is essential for creating and managing apps that interact with Instagram.
   - Note that changes to the developer portal may occur, so ensure you follow the latest interface, which might include options like “Usecases” for new app setups.

4. **Create and Configure a Facebook App:**
   - In the developer portal, create a new app and select “Business” as the category. Choose your platform (e.g., Web for websites, Mobile for apps).
   - Add the Instagram API product by navigating to “Products” in your app settings, selecting “Facebook Login,” and then “Instagram API.” Configure these products according to your needs, such as setting up redirect URIs for login.

5. **Implement Facebook Login and Request Permissions:**
   - Configure your app to use Facebook Login, which authenticates users and grants access to Instagram data. This involves setting up the login flow for your chosen platform (iOS, Web, Android).
   - Request necessary permissions, such as `pages_show_list` (to access Facebook pages) and `instagram_basic` (for basic Instagram data). These permissions may require app review for approval, especially for production use.

6. **Obtain an Access Token:**
   - Use the Facebook Login flow to log into your app with your Facebook account, ensuring you’re also logged into your Developer account.
   - Grant the requested permissions (e.g., `instagram_basic`, `pages_show_list`), and you’ll receive a User access token. This token is crucial for making API calls and is detailed in resources like [Phyllo: Instagram Graph APIs](https://www.getphyllo.com/post/instagram-graph-apis-what-are-they-and-how-do-developers-access-them).

7. **Make API Calls Using the Instagram Graph API:**
   - With the access token, you can now interact with the Instagram Graph API. This API allows you to manage media, reply to comments, analyze insights, conduct hashtag searches, and more, as described in the [Instagram Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram) documentation.
   - For example, you can fetch media, manage comments, or get metadata about other Instagram Businesses and Creators. Refer to the documentation for specific endpoints and parameters, as the API uses RESTful calls and requires proper authentication headers.

#### Key Considerations and Challenges
- **Deprecation of Instagram Basic Display API:** As mentioned, this API is deprecated, affecting all requests after December 4, 2024. Migration to the Graph API is recommended, and developers should update their applications accordingly. This change, announced in a [blog post](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2024/09/04/update-on-instagram-basic-display-api/), ensures compliance with current privacy standards.
- **App Review Process:** Your app may need to undergo a review process for certain permissions, especially if you’re building for public use. This involves submitting a screencast showing how a business will log in and use the feature, which can be time-consuming. For personal or development use, you can test in development mode, but production requires approval.
- **Account Requirements:** The Instagram Graph API is limited to Business and Creator accounts linked to Facebook pages, which may exclude personal accounts. This restriction, noted in articles like [Codementor: Connect & Manage Instagram Accounts](https://www.codementor.io/@abhij89/integration-connect-manage-instagram-accounts-via-facebook-graph-api-weu5tojoo), ensures professional use but can be a barrier for individual developers.
- **Integration Complexity:** Integrating the API can be challenging due to documentation updates and platform changes. For instance, some guides, like those from September 2022, may be outdated, as noted in [Superface.ai](https://superface.ai/blog/instagram-setup), requiring developers to cross-reference multiple sources.
