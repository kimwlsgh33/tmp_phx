#### Interacting with Claude Code: Core Features and Commands
Claude Code operates by understanding your project context automatically, exploring the codebase as needed. Here are key ways to interact with it:

- **Natural Language Commands**: You can ask questions or give instructions, such as:
  - `how does our authentication system work?` to understand code.
  - `commit my changes` for git operations.
  - `fix the type errors in the auth module` to edit code.
  - `run tests for the auth module and fix failures` for testing and debugging.
  - `think about how we should architect the new payment service` for deep thinking tasks.

- **Slash Commands**: These provide additional functionality, including:
  - `/bug`: Report bugs directly to Anthropic.
  - `/clear`: Clear conversation history.
  - `/compact`: Save context space to reduce token usage.
  - `/config`: View or modify configuration settings.
  - `/cost`: Show current token usage for cost management.
  - `/doctor`: Check installation health.
  - `/help`: Get usage help.
  - `/init`: Initialize with a CLAUDE.md file for project summary.
  - `/login`: Switch accounts.
  - `/logout`: Sign out.
  - `/pr_comments`: View pull request comments.
  - `/review`: Request a code review.
  - `/terminal-setup`: Configure Shift+Enter for newlines, especially useful in iTerm2 or VSCode.

A table summarizing key CLI and slash commands is provided below for quick reference:

| **Command Type** | **Example Command**       | **Purpose**                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CLI               | `claude`                 | Start interactive REPL                          |

#### Permissions and Security
Claude Code prioritizes security with a direct API connection, ensuring no intermediate servers handle your queries. However, certain actions require user approval:
- Read-only actions (e.g., file reads) do not require approval.
- Actions like running bash commands or modifying files (e.g., FileEditTool, FileWriteTool) need explicit approval, with options to "Yes, don’t ask again" per project and command, or until the session ends.

This human-in-the-loop approach ensures safety, especially for actions that could alter your codebase.

#### Cost Management and Usage Tips
Usage of Claude Code can incur costs, typically estimated at $5-10 per day per developer, with potential spikes to over $100/hour during intensive use. To manage costs:
- Use `/compact` to save context space.
- Make specific, focused queries rather than broad ones.
- Break tasks into smaller commands.
- Use `/clear` to reset and reduce unnecessary token usage.

Additionally, for third-party API integration, such as Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, specific environment variables must be set, requiring respective AWS or GCP credentials, which can affect costs further.
