# Social Media Controller Refactoring

## Standardized Changes Across Controllers

1. **Import Consistency**:
   - All controllers now consistently import the same set of functions from SocialMediaController
   - Added missing imports like check_auth, parse_hashtags, and get_expiry_datetime where needed

2. **Authentication Check**:
   - Standardized authentication verification using check_auth instead of direct API calls
   - Uniform pattern matching for authentication responses

3. **Media Upload Process**:
   - All controllers now follow the same process for validating and uploading media
   - Used consistent parameter handling and error handling patterns

4. **Controller Actions**:
   - Standardized the implementation of show, connect, auth_callback actions
   - Made upload_form and upload_media/upload_video actions consistent across platforms
   
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error handling patterns for authentication failures
   - Standardized error messages and redirects

6. **Route Structure**:
   - Updated router for consistency across all social media providers
   - Ensured action names match functionality (upload_media vs upload_video)

## Controller-Specific Fixes

1. **YoutubeController**:
   - Fixed handle_media_upload import to use 5 parameters (was 4)
   - Added upload_form action for consistency
   - Implemented proper media validation

2. **TwitterController**:
   - Switched from direct Twitter.authenticated? calls to check_auth
   - Added missing imports for full functionality
   - Standardized auth response handling

3. **TiktokController**:
   - Added missing imports for parse_hashtags, handle_post, etc.
   - Updated auth handling to match other controllers

4. **InstagramController**:
   - No major changes as it was already using check_auth and had all proper imports

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Code is more consistent and follows the same patterns
2. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new social media platforms
3. **Bug Prevention**: Standardized error handling prevents platform-specific bugs
4. **Code Reuse**: Leveraging the shared SocialMediaController functionality
