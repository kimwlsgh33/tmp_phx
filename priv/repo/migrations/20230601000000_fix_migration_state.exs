  This migration does not make any actual changes to the database schema.
  
  It exists solely to synchronize the migration state tracking (in the schema_migrations table)
  with the actual database schema. This is necessary because the database schema is ahead of
  the migration files due to a merge from another branch where migrations were already applied.

    # Its purpose is only to mark a point in the migration history where
    # we acknowledge that the database schema is already in the correct state,
    # even though some migration files might be showing as "down".
    
    # Execute this migration with:
    # mix ecto.migrate
