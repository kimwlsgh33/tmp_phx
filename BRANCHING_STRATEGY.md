## Main Branches

### `main` (or `master`)

- Contains **production-ready** code
- Every commit is deployable to production
- Direct pushes are prohibited
- All code is thoroughly tested
- Tagged with version numbers for releases (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- Infinite lifetime

### `develop`

- Main development branch
- Contains latest delivered development changes
- Source for feature branches
- Should be relatively stable
- Infinite lifetime

## Supporting Branches

### Feature Branches (`feature/*`)

- **Purpose**: Developing new features
- **Naming**: `feature/descriptive-feature-name`
- **Branch from**: `develop`
- **Merge to**: `develop`
- **Lifetime**: Short (1-2 weeks recommended)
- **Example**: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/payment-gateway`

### Bugfix Branches (`fix/*`)

- **Purpose**: Fixing bugs in development
- **Naming**: `fix/bug-description`
- **Branch from**: `develop`
- **Merge to**: `develop`
- **Lifetime**: Very short (1-3 days recommended)
- **Example**: `fix/login-validation-error`, `fix/incorrect-calculation`

### Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)

- **Purpose**: Critical fixes for production issues
- **Naming**: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Branch from**: `main`
- **Merge to**: Both `main` and `develop`
- **Lifetime**: Extremely short (hours to days)
- **Example**: `hotfix/security-vulnerability`, `hotfix/server-crash`

### Release Branches (`release/*`)

- **Purpose**: Prepare for a new production release
- **Naming**: `release/vX.Y.Z` (semantic versioning)
- **Branch from**: `develop`
- **Merge to**: Both `main` and `develop`
- **Lifetime**: Short (days to week)
- **Example**: `release/v1.0.0`, `release/v2.3.1`

### Documentation Branches (`docs/*`)

- **Purpose**: Documentation updates separate from code changes
- **Naming**: `docs/documentation-description`
- **Branch from**: `develop`
- **Merge to**: `develop`
- **Lifetime**: Short
- **Example**: `docs/api-documentation`, `docs/update-readme`

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Workflow

```
# Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Work on the feature with regular commits
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature component"

# Push feature branch to remote (first time)
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Regular pushes after first time
git push

# Keep in sync with develop (regularly)
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop
# resolve any conflicts

# When feature is complete, create a pull request to develop
# After PR approval and merge, delete branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

### Hotfix Workflow

```
# Create a hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical production bug"

# Push changes
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-bug

# Create a pull request to main
# After approval and merge to main, merge to develop as well
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge origin/hotfix/critical-bug
git push origin develop

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug
```

### Release Workflow

```
# Create a release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Make release-specific tweaks
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# Push release branch
git push -u origin release/v1.2.0

# Create a pull request to main
# After approval and merge to main, tag the release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Version 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0

# Also merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge release/v1.2.0
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/v1.2.0
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep branches short-lived**
   - Feature branches should ideally last no more than 1-2 weeks
   - Regularly merge from the parent branch to avoid big conflicts

2. **Meaningful commits**
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Start with a verb in imperative form: "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove", etc.
   - Example: "Add user authentication feature" rather than "user auth"

3. **Clean before merging**
   - Squash commits when appropriate to maintain a clean history
   - Ensure all tests pass before creating a pull request

4. **Regular synchronization**
   - Regularly pull from parent branches to reduce merge conflicts
   - Resolve conflicts promptly when they occur

5. **Branch hygiene**
   - Delete branches after they're merged
   - Keep local and remote repositories in sync

6. **Code reviews**
   - All changes to `develop` and `main` should go through pull requests
   - Enforce code reviews for all pull requests

7. **Protect critical branches**
   - Set up branch protection rules for `main` and `develop`

## Branch Protection Rules

### `main` Branch Protection

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Include administrators in these restrictions
- Protect against force pushes

### `develop` Branch Protection

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Prevent direct pushes (except by administrators in emergency situations)
- Allow rebase merging to maintain a cleaner history

This branching strategy is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the team's needs. It can be modified as the project evolves and as the team identifies improvements in the workflow.
